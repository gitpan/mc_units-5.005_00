?S:alignbytes:
?S:	This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a
?S:	double. Usual values are 2, 4 and 8.
?S:.
?X: This used to be called ALIGNBYTES, but that conflicts with
?X: <machines/param.h> in NetBSD.
?C:MEM_ALIGNBYTES (ALIGNBYTES):
?C:	 This symbol contains the number of bytes required to align a
?C:	 double. Usual values are 2, 4 and 8.
?C:	 On NeXT starting with 3.2, you can build "Fat" Multiple Architecture
?C:	 Binaries (MAB) for targets with varying alignment.  This only matters
?C:	 for perl, where the config.h can be generated and installed on one
?C:	 system, and used by a different architecture to build an extension.
?C:	 The default is eight, for safety.
